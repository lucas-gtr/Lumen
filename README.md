# Lumen

Lumen is a modern C++20 3D rendering engine built from scratch, designed to explore both real-time and offline rendering. It features a physically-based CPU path tracer with microfacet BRDFs (GGX), Multiple Importance Sampling, and BVH acceleration, alongside a real-time OpenGL viewport ‚Äî demonstrating my amy skills in computer graphics and software engineering.

## üß© Architecture Overview

The project is structured into distinct modules to ensure maintainability and scalability:

- **Core:** Fundamental utilities and data structures
- **BVH** : Manages the BVH construction
- **Surface:** Manages materials and textures
- **Geometry:** Responsible for mesh creation and loading
- **Lighting:** Defines different light types and their behaviors
- **SceneObjects** : Manages objects of the scene such as 3D Objects and Camera
- **Scene:** Manages the Scene and the Skybox.
- **Rendering:** Handles the rendering pipeline and settings
- **OpenGL:** Manages the real-time rendering view, shaders, framebuffers, and OpenGL-specific resources  
- **GUI**: Implements the user interface and interaction logic using Qt and Qt Designer (.ui files), enabling intuitive control and visualization of scene components.
- **Export:** Manages the export of rendered images

This modular design facilitates independent development and testing of each component.

## üìö Documentation

The project is available with a Doxygen documentation. The documentation has been deployed with GitHub Pages and is accessible from this link : [https://lucas-gtr.github.io/Lumen/](https://lucas-gtr.github.io/Lumen/).

It includes detailed class references and module overviews.

## üñºÔ∏è Rendering Pipeline

- **Ray Sampling**: Monte Carlo path tracing with stratified sampling per pixel, ensuring uniform stochastic coverage and improved convergence with reduced noise
- **Configurable Sampling**: The number of samples per pixel is fully configurable, allowing a balance between image quality and rendering time
- **Light Transport**: Supports direct and indirect lighting via global illumination. Paths are traced recursively with Russian Roulette termination to optimize performance without bias
- **BRDF Sampling**: Uses importance sampling of the GGX microfacet distribution, combined with Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) for efficient and realistic light integration
- **Color Accuracy & Tone Mapping**: All shading is performed in linear space. Final output undergoes gamma correction and tone mapping using operators such as `Exposure`, `Reinhard`, `ACES`, and `Uncharted2`

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.10 or higher
- OpenGL 3.3 or higher
- Qt 6.x with the following modules:
  - `QtWidgets`
  - `QtOpenGLWidgets`

### Building the Project

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lucas-gtr/Lumen.git
cd Lumen
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Optional Build Flags
- `ENABLE_COMPILE_WARNINGS`: Enable compiler warnings (default: ON)
- `ENABLE_SANITIZERS`: Enable address and undefined behavior sanitizers (default: ON)
- `ENABLE_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATIONS`: Enable compiler optimizations (default: ON)
- `ENABLE_LTO`: Enable Link Time Optimization (default: OFF)

### Running the Application
```bash
make run
```

This command will simply launches the Qt application.  
From the graphical interface, you can then:
- Create various meshes (cube, sphere, plane)
- Load OBJ models
- Add and customize directional, point, and spot lights
- Set up materials with diffuse and emissive textures, normal maps, emissive strength, roughness and metalness
- Configure a camera with aperture, focus distance, and field of view
- Adjust tone mapping, exposure, and post-processing settings in real-time
- Trigger a path-traced render (single- or multi-threaded) and export the image

## ‚úÖ Continuous Integration
The project employs GitHub Actions for continuous integration, ensuring code quality and reliability through automated workflows:

- Formatting & Linting: Utilizes clang-format and clang-tidy to enforce code style and detect potential issues.
- Testing: Runs unit tests using GoogleTest to validate functionality.

These workflows are triggered on pull requests to the `main` branch, maintaining code integrity and facilitating collaborative development.

### üß™ Testing & Coverage
Unit tests are located in the tests/ directory and can be executed as follows:

```bash
make run-tests
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
make coverage
```

## üöß Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for future development:

- **Real-Time Viewport Enhancements**: Add support for post-processing effects such as Bloom, Fog, and Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) to enhance visual realism.
- **Deferred Shading Pipeline**: Introduce a deferred renderer to decouple geometry pass from lighting calculations, allowing efficient rendering of complex scenes with many lights.
- **glTF Support**: Implement a glTF 2.0 parser for loading entire scenes.
- **GPU Acceleration with CUDA**: Port the path tracer to CUDA to significantly reduce render times and enable real-time or near real-time feedback for high-quality previews.
